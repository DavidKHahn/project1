# Project One: 

We created a webpage using Firebase database,  Google Maps API, and Foursquare API.  The webpage is used to ask 3 questions which will locate a list of places using Foursquare's API for Best Nearby Places while Firebase is collecting user data into it's database for future reference.  Google Maps will present the user with directions.
